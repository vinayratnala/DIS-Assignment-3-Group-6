            The Information gathered from the study is classified into numerous classifications dependent on factors like Typology, Economy, Deals, age, and so on The classifications are sub-characterized into numerous divisions. Every classification is given a short ID with a depiction expressing the capacity of the Class. For example, Monetary Class (Sal) is isolated into classes like $1,000,000 and the sky is the limit from there; $500,000 to $999,999 and so on Along these lines, different classifications have their sub-classes to additionally characterize the information. 

Classifications are meta labels that give setting to the information. The Information gathered from the overview is ordered into various classifications dependent on factors like Typology, Economy, Deals, age, and so forth The classifications are sub-ordered into numerous divisions. Every class is given a short ID with a depiction expressing the capacity of the Classification. For example, Financial Class (Sal) is partitioned into classes like $1,000,000 and the sky is the limit from there; $500,000 to $999,999 etc.Also, for Ranch Asset District, the information is ordered into classes like Heartland, Northern Bow, and so on Likewise, different classes have their subclasses to additionally characterize the information.
